"""
Step 0 of every run: prove the pipeline reproduces Zorora's locked numbers.

The locked numbers were verified in July 2026 and must never change.
If the code produces anything different, the CODE is wrong, so the run stops.

There are two kinds of check here:
  A. Full-data checks: on all the data, every locked number must come out exactly.
  B. As-of checks: a report dated in the past must not "see" anything after its date.
